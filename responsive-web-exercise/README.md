# Exercise 1

We will transform this fixed layout page to be responsive!

1. Give the main container a maximum width of 960 pixels
2. When the screen is smaller than 960 pixels wide, make the main container fill the entire width of the screen
3. Make the `header` and `nav` elements always fill the width of the main container
4. When the screen is smaller than 960 pixels wide: make the `aside` and `article` proportional to how they are when the screen is 960 pixels wide or larger
5. Make sure the `img` in the `aside` fills the width of the `aside`
6. Find the "break point" where the header no longer fits on one line. When this happens, make it so that the font size is small enough to fit on one line
7. Using the same break point you found in step 6, we're going to stack the `aside` and `article` vertically, taking up the full width of the screen

## BONUS
1. The images in the portfolio section should line up 4 to a row if the screen is 932 pixels or wider
2. The images in the portfolio section should line up 3 to a row (and thus take up the entire width) if the screen is less than 932 pixels wide, but still bigger than the break point you found for step 6 above
3. When the `aside` and `article` are stacked up vertically, the images in the portfolio section should have 2 per row, and take up the entire width
